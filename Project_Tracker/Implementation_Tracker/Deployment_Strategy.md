# UGENTIC Framework Deployment Strategy for SME-Alpha

## 1. Deployment Method

*   **Type:** Local On-Premise Deployment
*   **Location:** A dedicated machine (e.g., a workstation or server) within SME-Alpha's premises.
*   **Rationale:** Ensures data privacy and security, avoids cloud costs, and simplifies initial setup for a research project.

## 2. Technical Environment Setup

*   **Operating System:** Compatible with Python 3.9+ (e.g., Windows 10/11, Ubuntu LTS).
*   **Python Environment:** A dedicated Python virtual environment (`.venv`) will be created to manage project dependencies.
*   **Dependencies:** All required Python packages will be installed from `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## 3. LLM Backend Configuration

*   **Platform:** Ollama (local LLM server).
*   **Installation:** Ollama will be installed and configured on the deployment machine.
*   **Embedding Model:** `nomic-embed-text` (or a suitable alternative) will be pulled and run via Ollama for RAG embeddings.
*   **Agent Reasoning LLM:** A capable local LLM (e.g., `llama3`, `mistral`, `phi3`) will be pulled and run via Ollama for agent reasoning and decision-making.

## 4. Data Storage

*   **RAG Documents:** All documents used for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (e.g., company policies, market reports) will be stored locally on the deployment machine's file system.
*   **Agent Memory:** Agent-specific memory (key-value pairs) will be stored in-memory during runtime, with options for file-based persistence if required for longer-term memory (future enhancement).

## 5. User Interaction

*   **Primary Interface:** Command-Line Interface (`cli.py`). Users will interact with the Orchestrator by typing high-level goals into the terminal.
*   **Future Interfaces:** Potential for web-based or API interfaces in later development phases, but not within the scope of the initial case study deployment.

## 6. Maintenance and Updates

*   **Code Updates:** Manual `git pull` from the repository.
*   **Dependency Updates:** `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`.
*   **LLM Model Updates:** `ollama pull <model_name>`.

## 7. Data Privacy and Security

*   All data remains on SME-Alpha's local machine.
*   No external cloud services are used for processing or storage.
*   Access to the machine is controlled by SME-Alpha's internal security policies.
