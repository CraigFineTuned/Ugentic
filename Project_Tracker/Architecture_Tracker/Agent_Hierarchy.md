# üè¢ AGENT HIERARCHY - UGENTIC DEPARTMENTAL STRUCTURE (v2)

**Version:** 2.0 (Revolutionary Integration Update)
**Principle:** A circular, tool-augmented collective, managed by an Orchestrator.

---

## 1. Architectural Overview

The UGENTIC hierarchy is not a top-down pyramid but a **tool-augmented circular collective**. A central **Orchestrator Agent** manages the primary workflow, but the five **Departmental Agents** have the autonomy to use their tools and consult with each other to achieve collective goals.

Each agent is a composite entity: **Persona + Toolkit**. The agent's intelligence lies in its ability to dynamically choose the right tool for a given task. This is not a hard-coded process; instead, the agent's core LLM reasons over the task description and the descriptions of its available tools to make an intelligent, in-the-moment decision on which tool to use and how to use it.

## 2. The MCP Toolkit (Legend)

This is the master list of practical capabilities available to the agents.

| Tool                 | Core Function                                      |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Fetch**            | Retrieves raw data from **valid web URLs** (http/https).        |
| **Research**         | Synthesizes information from multiple sources, including **internal documents (via RAG)** and **external web content (via Fetch)**, into coherent analysis.    |
| **Filesystem**       | Reads from and writes to the local file system, **strictly adhering to provided or discovered absolute paths**.    |
| **Git**              | Interacts with Git repositories to analyze code.   |
| **Decision**         | Provides structured go/no-go or ranked-choice judgments. |
| **SequentialThinking** | Manages complex, multi-step workflows.             |
| **Memory**           | Provides a persistent key-value store for agents.  |
| **Time**             | Provides the current date and time.                |
