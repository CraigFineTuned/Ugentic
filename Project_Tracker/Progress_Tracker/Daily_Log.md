### **Day 10: August 19, 2025**

**‚úÖ Accomplishments:**
1.  **Formalized Academic Submission:** Created a comprehensive research proposal, a detailed literature review, and a completed topic submission form to formalize the project for academic review.
2.  **Prepared Supervisor Communication:** Drafted and refined an initial submission email to the supervisor, Jemina Matiya, including all necessary attachments.
3.  **Created Concise Summaries:** Developed executive summary versions of the proposal and literature review for a more streamlined initial submission.
4.  **Prepared Administrative Follow-up:** Drafted a follow-up email to the registrar to confirm submission processes and inquire about next steps.

**üîë Key Decisions:**
- Decided to create both full and summary versions of academic documents to provide flexibility in supervisor communication.
- Shifted project focus from pure development to documentation synchronization and preparation for the case study phase.

**Tomorrow's Plan:**
- Begin comprehensive update of all project documentation to ensure consistency.
- Start outlining the plan for the SME case study.

**‚ö°Ô∏è Energy Level:** High

**ü§î Reflection:**
- This marks a major transition from technical implementation to academic formalization and practical deployment planning. The project is now well-positioned for its next phase.

### **Day 9: August 21, 2025**

**‚úÖ Accomplishments:**
1.  **Refined Agent Personas for File Path Guidance:** Modified the `persona` strings for Finance, HR, Operations, Marketing, and Sales agents in `src/ugentic/agents/departmental_agents.py` to explicitly instruct them on using absolute paths for `AnalysisTool` and `FilesystemTool` interactions.

**üîë Key Decisions:**
- Reinforced LLM guidance at the agent-specific level to improve consistency in file path usage.

**Challenges:**
- Ensuring the new persona instructions are clear and effective for the LLM.

**Tomorrow's Plan:**
- Re-run end-to-end test to verify improved file path usage.
- Continue with SME preparation tasks as outlined in Sprint 9.

**‚ö°Ô∏è Energy Level:** High

**ü§î Reflection:**
- This refinement aims to further reduce LLM hallucinations related to file paths, making the system even more reliable.
