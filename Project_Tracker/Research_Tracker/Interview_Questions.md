## **SCRIPT 2: POST-IMPLEMENTATION INTERVIEW (v2)**

**Objective:** To evaluate the impact of the **tool-augmented** UGENTIC system and gather user feedback on the new capabilities.

**Introduction:**
"Thank you again for participating in this study. Now that you've used the UGENTIC system for several key decisions, I'd like to discuss your experience, focusing on the new tool-using capabilities. As before, this is confidential and will be anonymized."

### **Part 1: UGENTIC Experience**

1.  Can you describe your experience using the UGENTIC system? What was it like to interact with the departmental agents?
2.  How did the process of reaching a decision with UGENTIC differ from your traditional methods?
3.  Did the system's dialogue-based approach help in understanding the perspectives of other departments? In what way?
4.  Was there a time when the system presented a viewpoint or data that you hadn't considered?

#### **Experience with Tools (New Section)**

5.  The agents used several tools in the background (like `Fetch` to get web data or `Filesystem` to read documents). Was it clear when and why the agents were using these tools?
6.  Did having the agents use tools to gather real-time data or access internal documents increase your trust in their suggestions?
7.  Was there a particular tool that you found especially helpful or unhelpful? Why?
8.  How did the agents' ability to perform actions (not just talk) change your perception of the system's usefulness?

### **Part 2: Impact & Outcomes**

9.  Comparing the decisions made with UGENTIC to those made before, do you feel the quality of the outcomes was different? Better, worse, or the same? Why?
10. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the efficiency of the decision-making process using UGENTIC? How does that compare to your previous score?
11. Did you feel more or less aligned with the final decisions? Why?
12. What were the biggest benefits and biggest drawbacks of using the system?
13. If UGENTIC were a permanent tool, what changes or improvements would you suggest?

**Wrap-up:**
"Your feedback is crucial for the evaluation of this research. Thank you so much for your time and effort throughout this entire case study."
