# UGENTIC Framework Case Study: Data Collection Methodology

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the methodology for collecting data during the case study of the UGENTIC framework's deployment at SME-Alpha. The aim is to gather both qualitative and quantitative (where feasible) data to assess the framework's effectiveness, usability, and impact on decision-making.

## 2. Data Sources and Collection Methods

### 2.1. Agent Interaction Logs (Primary Data Source)

*   **What to Collect:**
    *   All prompts sent to the Orchestrator and individual agents.
    *   LLM responses (raw and parsed JSON).
    *   Tool calls (tool name, action, parameters).
    *   Tool outputs (results, errors).
    *   Timestamp for each interaction.
*   **Method:** Automated logging within the UGENTIC framework. Logs will be stored in a structured format (e.g., JSON lines) in the `Logs/` directory.
*   **Purpose:** To reconstruct and analyze the agent's reasoning process, tool utilization, and decision pathways.

### 2.2. User Feedback (Qualitative)

*   **What to Collect:** Perceptions of decision quality, efficiency gains, ease of use, and overall satisfaction.
*   **Method:**
    *   **Post-Problem Interviews:** Short, structured interviews with SME-Alpha's CEO/stakeholders after each major problem-solving session.
    *   **Ad-hoc Feedback:** Encourage users to provide immediate feedback during interactions.
*   **Purpose:** To understand the human perspective on the framework's value and identify areas for improvement.

### 2.3. Business Metrics (Qualitative/Observational)

*   **What to Collect:**
    *   Time taken to reach a decision (pre-UGENTIC vs. with UGENTIC).
    *   Perceived comprehensiveness of information gathered.
    *   Confidence in the final decision.
*   **Method:** Primarily observational and self-reported during interviews. Direct quantitative measurement may be challenging in a short case study.
*   **Purpose:** To assess the practical impact of the framework on SME-Alpha's operations.

### 2.4. Researcher Observations and Field Notes

*   **What to Collect:** Detailed notes on system behavior, unexpected interactions, environmental factors, and any issues encountered during deployment and usage.
*   **Method:** Continuous observation by the researcher during all framework interactions and setup.
*   **Purpose:** To provide rich contextual data and identify unforeseen challenges or opportunities.

## 3. Data Storage and Anonymization

*   **Storage:** All collected data will be stored securely on the deployment machine and periodically backed up.
*   **Anonymization:** Sensitive business data will be anonymized or generalized where possible to protect SME-Alpha's privacy.

## 4. Data Analysis

*   **Agent Logs:** Content analysis to identify patterns in tool use, common reasoning paths, and areas where LLM performance can be improved.
*   **Qualitative Data:** Thematic analysis of interview transcripts and field notes to identify recurring themes and insights.
*   **Correlation:** Attempt to correlate agent performance (from logs) with user feedback and observed business metrics.
