# About This Directory: The UGENTIC Project Tracker

**Version:** 2.0
**Status:** Authoritative Guide

---

## 1. Purpose

This `Project_Tracker` directory is the single source of truth for the UGENTIC project. It contains all documentation related to the project's vision, architecture, planning, progress, and academic submissions. Its structure is designed to be logical and manageable, allowing any stakeholder to quickly understand the project's status.

## 2. Core Foundational Documents

Located at the root of this directory are the two most important files that govern the entire project:

*   **`NEVER_CHANGING_VISION.md`**: The immutable "North Star" of the project. It defines the core mission, philosophy (Ubuntu), and non-negotiable architectural principles.
*   **`NEVER_CHANGING_PRIVATE_PROMPT.md`**: The operational protocol for the AI partner (Gemini). It defines the roles, responsibilities, and interaction loop for our collaboration.
