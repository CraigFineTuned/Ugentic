## 📖 Overview

UGENTIC is a revolutionary AI framework that transforms traditional hierarchical business structures into Ubuntu-driven departmental collective intelligence systems. Unlike conventional AI implementations, UGENTIC operationalizes African Ubuntu philosophy through authentic departmental agents that mirror real SME structures while embodying collaborative interdependence.

**Key Innovation:** Real departments (Finance, HR, Operations, Marketing, Sales) as specialized AI agents that reach consensus through natural dialogue, not voting or mathematical calculation.
