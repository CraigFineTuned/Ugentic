Enter a high-level goal for the Orchestrator (or 'exit' to quit): As the CEO, I need a comprehensive strategic plan for launching a new product line. This plan should include: Market Analysis (target demographics, competitive landscape, market size); Financial Projections (3-year revenue forecast, cost analysis, profitability); Operational Requirements (resources, production timelines, supply chain); HR Impact (staffing, training, organizational changes); Sales Strategy (go-to-market, pricing, distribution). Ensure recommendations are supported by internal policy documents and external market research. Provide a consolidated summary of key findings and actionable recommendations.
